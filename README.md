## About

Based on a responsive template, I added a footer with social media links and animations, a button to scroll to the top of the page, and a “read more” button. I also adjusted colors and other details, such as replacing the “My Profile” link in the persistent social media menu with a WhatsApp link.

Before this project, I hadn’t worked with Tailwind CSS, but I enjoyed it more than I expected. I plan to study it further and perhaps use it in some of my upcoming projects. Overall, this project was a lot of fun to develop.

## Hosting

I obtained the domain using the student coupon from Namecheap offered through the GitHub Student Developer Pack. I deployed the project on DigitalOcean also leveraging the GSDP. Since I deployed it on the App Platform rather than a Droplet, I didn’t need to worry about SSL certificates, and finally, it was only necessary to redirect the DNS in Namecheap so that the domain pointed to the online app on DigitalOcean.
